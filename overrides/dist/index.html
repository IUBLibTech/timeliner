            Timeliner is a reimplementation of Variations Audio Timeliner as a web
            application, using the IIIF Presentation API 3.0. As with the original
            version, developed as a part of the Variations Digital Music Library
            System, it is an audio annotation and analysis tool for creating and
            labeling bubble diagrams. These diagrams can be used to navigate music
            or other audio for detailed study.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to its use as a standalone application, the Timeliner is
            available as integrated feature within the successor to Variations,
            Avalon Media System. Avalon users can create new bubble diagrams
            directly from item pages within their Avalon instance and edit, share
            and copy timelines across all items in the repository.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that due to standard browser security, audio resources used
            with Timeliner must be set up for Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
            This is not necessarily the case for many resources on the web, and not
            all URLs for media files may work.
